SESE-SEKO WIDOW OF LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU\nSESE-SEKO OF ZAIRE? NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC\nOF CONGO (DRC).  I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER,\nTHIS WAS IN CONFIDENCE  CONSIDERING MY PRESENTCIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION.\nI ESCAPED ALONG WITH MY HUSBAND AND TWO OF OUR SONS\nGEORGE  KONGOLO  AND BASHER  OUT OF DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF\nCONGO (DRC) TO ABIDJAN, COTE D'IVOIRE WHERE MY FAMILY\nAND I SETTLED, WHILE WE LATER MOVED  TO SETTLED IN\nMORROCO WHERE MY HUSBAND LATER DIED OF CANCER\nDISEASE. HOWEVER DUE TO THIS SITUATION WE DECIDED TO\nCHANGED  MOST OF MY HUSBAND'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS\nDEPOSITED IN SWISS BANK AND OTHER COUNTRIES INTO OTHER\nFORMS OF MONEY CODED FOR  SAFE PURPOSE BECAUSE THE NEW\nHEAD OF STATE OF (DR) MR LAURENT  KABILA HAS MADE\nARRANGEMENT WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER\nEUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY LATE HUSBAND'S\nTREASURES  DEPOSITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HENCE\nMY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA TO\nSTUDY THE SITUATION TILL  WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER,\nLIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT KABILA IS DEAD AND THE SON\nTAKING OVER (JOSEPH KABILA). ONE OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S\nCHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED  BY THE\nFRENCH GOVERNMENT, AND AS SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY\nIDENTITY  SO THAT MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND\nCONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM EIGHTEEN MILLION\nUNITED STATE DOLLARS(US$18,000,000,00.)  WITH A\nSECURITY COMPANY , FOR SAFEKEEPING. THE  FUNDS ARE\nSECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM\nKNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO\nINDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US BY RECEIVING THE MONEY ON OUR\nBEHALF.ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE, SO THAT I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY SON\n(KONGOLO) WHO HAS THE OUT MODALITIES FOR THE CLAIM OF THE SAID FUNDS. I\nWANT YOU TO ASSIST IN INVESTING THIS MONEY, BUT I WILL NOT WANT MY IDENTITY\nREVEALED. I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND STOCK IN MULTI-NATIONAL\nCOMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND\nNON-SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS. MAY I AT THIS POINT\nEMPHASISE THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY,  WHICH\nTHIS BUSINESS DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY\nTHE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE, WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU. IN\nCONCLUSION,  IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST US , MY SON SHALL\nPUT YOU IN THE PICTURE  OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU\nWHERE THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY BEING  MAINTAINED AND\nALSO DISCUSS OTHER MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATIONFOR YOUR SERVICES.\nFOR THIS REASON KINDLY FURNISH US YOUR CONTACT\nINFORMATION, THAT IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND FAX\nNUMBER FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE.BEST REGARDS,MRS M.

SESE-SEKO WIDOW OF LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU\nSESE-SEKO OF ZAIRE? NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC\nOF CONGO (DRC).  I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER,\nTHIS WAS IN CONFIDENCE  CONSIDERING MY PRESENTCIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION.\nI ESCAPED ALONG WITH MY HUSBAND AND TWO OF OUR SONS\nGEORGE  KONGOLO  AND BASHER  OUT OF DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF\nCONGO (DRC) TO ABIDJAN, COTE D'IVOIRE WHERE MY FAMILY\nAND I SETTLED, WHILE WE LATER MOVED  TO SETTLED IN\nMORROCO WHERE MY HUSBAND LATER DIED OF CANCER\nDISEASE. HOWEVER DUE TO THIS SITUATION WE DECIDED TO\nCHANGED  MOST OF MY HUSBAND'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS\nDEPOSITED IN SWISS BANK AND OTHER COUNTRIES INTO OTHER\nFORMS OF MONEY CODED FOR  SAFE PURPOSE BECAUSE THE NEW\nHEAD OF STATE OF (DR) MR LAURENT  KABILA HAS MADE\nARRANGEMENT WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER\nEUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY LATE HUSBAND'S\nTREASURES  DEPOSITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HENCE\nMY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA TO\nSTUDY THE SITUATION TILL  WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER,\nLIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT KABILA IS DEAD AND THE SON\nTAKING OVER (JOSEPH KABILA). ONE OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S\nCHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED  BY THE\nFRENCH GOVERNMENT, AND AS SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY\nIDENTITY  SO THAT MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND\nCONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM EIGHTEEN MILLION\nUNITED STATE DOLLARS(US$18,000,000,00.)  WITH A\nSECURITY COMPANY , FOR SAFEKEEPING. THE  FUNDS ARE\nSECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM\nKNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO\nINDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US BY RECEIVING THE MONEY ON OUR\nBEHALF.ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE, SO THAT I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY SON\n(KONGOLO) WHO HAS THE OUT MODALITIES FOR THE CLAIM OF THE SAID FUNDS. I\nWANT YOU TO ASSIST IN INVESTING THIS MONEY, BUT I WILL NOT WANT MY IDENTITY\nREVEALED. I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND STOCK IN MULTI-NATIONAL\nCOMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND\nNON-SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS.

SESE-SEKO WIDOW OF LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU\nSESE-SEKO OF ZAIRE? NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC\nOF CONGO (DRC).  I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER,\nTHIS WAS IN CONFIDENCE  CONSIDERING MY PRESENTCIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION.\nI ESCAPED ALONG WITH MY HUSBAND AND TWO OF OUR SONS\nGEORGE  KONGOLO  AND BASHER  OUT OF DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF\nCONGO (DRC) TO ABIDJAN, COTE D'IVOIRE WHERE MY FAMILY\nAND I SETTLED, WHILE WE LATER MOVED  TO SETTLED IN\nMORROCO WHERE MY HUSBAND LATER DIED OF CANCER\nDISEASE. HOWEVER DUE TO THIS SITUATION WE DECIDED TO\nCHANGED  MOST OF MY HUSBAND'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS\nDEPOSITED IN SWISS BANK AND OTHER COUNTRIES INTO OTHER\nFORMS OF MONEY CODED FOR  SAFE PURPOSE BECAUSE THE NEW\nHEAD OF STATE OF (DR) MR LAURENT  KABILA HAS MADE\nARRANGEMENT WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER\nEUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY LATE HUSBAND'S\nTREASURES  DEPOSITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HENCE\nMY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA TO\nSTUDY THE SITUATION TILL  WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER,\nLIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT KABILA IS DEAD AND THE SON\nTAKING OVER (JOSEPH KABILA). ONE OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S\nCHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED  BY THE\nFRENCH GOVERNMENT, AND AS SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY\nIDENTITY  SO THAT MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND\nCONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM EIGHTEEN MILLION\nUNITED STATE DOLLARS(US$18,000,000,00.)  WITH A\nSECURITY COMPANY , FOR SAFEKEEPING. THE  FUNDS ARE\nSECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM\nKNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO\nINDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US BY RECEIVING THE MONEY ON OUR\nBEHALF.ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE, SO THAT I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY SON\n(KONGOLO) WHO HAS THE OUT MODALITIES FOR THE CLAIM OF THE SAID FUNDS. I\nWANT YOU TO ASSIST IN INVESTING THIS MONEY, BUT I WILL NOT WANT MY IDENTITY\nREVEALED. I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND STOCK IN MULTI-NATIONAL\nCOMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND\nNON-SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS.

When\nthe new academic year begins at UCC, every incoming student will\nbe offered a copy of Red Hat Linux 7.3.\nILUG member Braun Brelin proposed this promotion, when he ran a\ntraining class for staff at the UCC computer science department.\nBrelin, who is the director of technology at OpenApp, says that the\nLinux offer could be extended to any or all of the other Irish\nuniversities.\nThe user group is tapping into an international Red Hat programme\nthat aims to introduce students at all levels to the open source\nstyle of computing.  The Linux distributor runs an 'educational\nchannel' to reach this audience, bundling educational software\nwith its operating environment and offering networked support\nservices to eligible applicants.  This scheme was originally designed\nto suit the educational structures in the US, but is now available to\nschools and universities throughout the world.\nRed Hat Linux 7.3 incorporates ease of use and maintenance\nfeatures and is intended to counter objections that Linux is hard to\nmaster on personal systems.\nThe Linux-for-all project at UCC could also raise the profile of Red\nHat Ireland.  Based in Cork, this operation has run shared financial\nservices for other Red Hat offices in Europe since 2000.  Until now\nits involvement with users in Ireland has been fairly limited,\nalthough it does sometimes refer them to other Red Hat offices in\nEurope that offer consulting or technical support services.\nDavid Owens, Red Hat's director of global logistics and production,\nsees the formation of the ILUG marketing group as a reason to take\na more proactive approach.  In the last three months, he notes, his\noffice in Cork has received more and more calls from Irish\ncompanies that are interested in adopting Linux and has introduced\nsome to Red Hat pre-sales consultants.\n-------------\nMany thanks are due to Braun and David for working together on this one.\nRegards\nL.\n--\nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp:\/\/www.linux.ie\/mailman\/listinfo\/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie","63":"On Mon, 2 Sep 2002, Russell Turpin wrote:\n> Adam Beberg:\n> >Considering 90% of the fake job posting I see are for embedded systems or\n> >device drivers - C still rules the world.\n>\n> There is a lot of C++ in the embedded world.

However, the additional\ninformation won't be required.\nThe opinion could encourage the adoption of text-based political ads, as\ncampaign experts look for new technological ways to sway voters. At the\nsame time, opponents of the plan fear it could lead to anonymous\npolitical spam.\nTarget Wireless, a small New Jersey-based wireless media company, had\nasked the FEC for an opinion on the matter, saying that requiring\nfinancial disclosures on short messaging service (SMS) mailings would\nuse up too much of the 160 character-maximum.\nPolitical messages on bumper stickers and buttons are also exempt from\nthe financial disclosure requirement. Target Wireless' petition was\nsupported by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Cellular\nTelecommunications and Internet Association, and some advertising trade\ngroups.\nFEC spokesman Bob Biersack said the opinion was in keeping with the\ncommission's policy not to meddle with new technology that has the\npotential to reach more voters.\n\"We have tried very hard not to get in the way--particularly before\neveryone understands how the technology is going to work,\" he said.\nOpponents of the plan have worried the exemption might encourage spam or\nallow senders to blast people with mass amounts of negative political\nmessages while remaining anonymous.\nBiersack said the FEC can revisit the issue if those problems surface.\nTarget Wireless President Craig Krueger characterized the opinion as\n\"good for America.\"\n\"It will allow people to receive more communication from those running\nfor office,\" he said. \"We have free speech on our side.\"\n--------------080808010909060409040405--\nhttp:\/\/xent.com\/mailman\/listinfo\/fork","69":"--- In forteana@y..., \"D.McMann\" <dmcmann@b...> wrote:\n> Robert Moaby, 33, who sent death threats to staff, was also jailed\n> for hoarding indecent pictures of children on his home computer.\n> =========\n>\n> Hmm, if I didn't trust our government and secret police, I could\nlook at\n> this another way....\nThere is a bit of circumstantial evidence - apparently some MT\nlisters were approached by him (via email) - a little research in\ndejanews\/google groups showed a number of messages from him, clearly\nhoping to contact girls, appearing in \"alt.teens\" and similar groups -\nI just tried a Google Groups search on \"Robert Moaby\" and some of\nthem came top of the list.\nNote for Marie - \"MT\" stands for Mark Thomas, a slightly slimmer, UK\nversion of your Michael Moore - the mailing list is named after him.\nRob\n------------------------ Yahoo!

According to scuttlebutt that\nemerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,\nBritain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France's President\nJacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,\nthe decline of the French economy. \"The problem with the\nFrench,\" Bush afterwards confided in Blair, \"is that they don't\nhave a word for entrepreneur.\"\nThe source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness\nWilliams of Crosby, who claimed \"my good friend Tony Blair\" had\nrecently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.\nLloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness\nWilliams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did\nreceive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair's director of\ncommunications and strategy. \"I can tell you that the prime\nminister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly\nnever told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,\"\nCampbell told The Post. \"If she put this in a speech, it must\nhave been a joke.\"\nThis is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of\na jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than\nstellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories\ntoo hard, we can come up with three other instances we've\nchronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the\nmoment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the\nranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged\nas the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the\nintelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus\nquatrain which pontificated that the \"village idiot\" would win\nthe 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it\nwas the story of Bush's waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks\nto chortling up their sleeves.\nStories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual\nshortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they\nseemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this\npublic figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's ever\nbeen.

The developers of Gaim, an instant messenger client\nthat combines several different networks, found a vulnerability in the\nhyperlink handling code. The 'Manual' browser command passes an\nuntrusted string to the shell without escaping or reliable quoting,\npermitting an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the users\nmachine. Unfortunately, Gaim doesn't display the hyperlink before the\nuser clicks on it. Users who use other inbuilt browser commands aren't\nvulnerable.\nThe fixed version of Gaim no longer passes the user's manual browser\ncommand to the shell. Commands which contain the %s in quotes will\nneed to be amended, so they don't contain any quotes. The 'Manual'\nbrowser command can be edited in the 'General' pane of the\n'Preferences' dialog, which can be accessed by clicking 'Options' from\nthe login window, or 'Tools' and then 'Preferences' from the menu bar\nin the buddy list window.\nPlease download Gaim 0.59.1 or later using Red Carpet.

Bronson -\nthe serial hostage taker, not the movie star - has written a health and\nfitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary\nmuscle power.\n\nSolitary Fitness - a title which bears testament to the fact that Bronson, 48,\nhas spent 24 of his 28 prison years in solitary confinement - explains how he\nhas turned himself into a lean, mean, fitness machine while living 23 hours a\nday in a space just 12 feet by eight feet, on a diet of scrubs grub and at\nvirtually no cost.\n\nThe book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a\nfortune on gym memberships, protein supplements or designer trainers, and\nstarts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the\nexercise industry.\n\n\"I pick up a fitness mag, I start to laugh and I wipe my arse with it,\" is the\nopening paragraph penned by Bronson. \"It\u0092s a joke and a big con and they call\nme a criminal!\" You can\u0092t help feeling he has a point.\n\nThis is not the first book that Bronson has written from behind bars, having\nalready published Birdman Opens His Mind, which features drawings and poems\ncreated by Bronson while in prison. And he is not the first prisoner to\ndiscover creative expression while residing at Her Majesty\u0092s pleasure.\n\nJimmy Boyle, the Scots sculptor and novelist, discovered his artistic talents\nwhen he was sent to Barlinnie Prison\u0092s famous special unit, which aimed to\nhelp inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to\nexpress their emotions artistically. Boyle was sentenced to life for the\nmurder of \"Babs\" Rooney in 1967. Once released, he moved to Edinburgh where he\nhas become a respected artist. His first novel, Hero of the Underworld, was\npublished in 1999 and his autobiography, A Sense of Freedom, was made into an\naward-winning film.\n\nHugh Collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of William Mooney in\nGlasgow, and in his first year in Barlinnie prison stabbed three prison\nofficers, earning him an extra seven-year sentence. But, after being\ntransferred to the same unit that Boyle attended, he learned to sculpt and\ndeveloped an interest in art. He later published Autobiography of a Murderer,\na frank account of Glasgow\u0092s criminal culture in the 1960s, which received\ncritical praise.\n\nAnd Lord Archer doesn\u0092t seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books\nthat have made him millions while in jail. He recently signed a three-book\ndeal with Macmillan publishers worth a reported \u00a310 million, and is no doubt\nscribbling away as we speak.\n\nSo why is it that men like Collins, Bronson and Boyle, who can be so\ndestructive towards society on the outside, can become so creative once stuck\non the inside? Steve Richards, Bronson\u0092s publisher, has published many books\nabout criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both\npragmatic and profound.\n\nHe says: \"Prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have\nknown a stable environment, and this can be the first time they have the\nchance to focus on their creative skills.\n\n\"It may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an\neducation, if their early years have been hard. It could be the first time\nanyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents.\"\n\nHowever, Richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that. He says:\n\"Once they are behind bars, the cold light of day hits them, and they examine\nthe very essence of who they are.\n\n\"They ask themselves, am I a man who wants to be remembered for violence? Or\nam I a man who can contribute to society, who can be remembered for something\ngood?\"\n\nBronson - who was born Michael Gordon Peterson, but changed his name to that\nof the Hollywood star of the Death Wish films - has, so far, been remembered\nmainly for things bad. He was originally jailed for seven years for armed\nrobbery in 1974, and has had a series of sentences added to his original term\nover the years as a result of attacking people in prison. In 2000 he was\njailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly\ntwo days during a jail siege.\n\nStanding five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs, he is\nrenowned for his strength. He has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands\nand does up to 3,000 - yes, 3,000 - press-ups a day. As he puts it: \"I can hit\na man 20 times in four seconds, I can push 132 press ups in 60 seconds.\"\n\nBut judging by our current obsession with health and exercise, Solitary\nFitness might be the book which will see Bronson\u0092s face sitting on every\ncoffee table in the land. He might be the man to give us the dream body which\nso many so-called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into. Because\nBronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists.\n\n\"All this crap about high-protein drinks, pills, diets, it\u0092s just a load of\nbollocks and a multi-million-pound racket,\" he writes, in what can only be\ndescribed as a refreshingly honest style. \"We can all be fat lazy bastards,\nit\u0092s our choice, I\u0092m sick of hearing and reading about excuses, if you stuff\nyour face with shit you become shit, that\u0092s logical to me.\"\n\nAs motivational mantras go, that might be just the kick up the, er, backside\nwe all needed.\n\n\nSolitary Fitness by Charles Bronson is published by Mirage Publishing and will\nbe available in bookstores from October at \u00a37.99\n------------------------ Yahoo!

It is based on the SysV unix family, so it's quite similar to\nother unixen like HPUX and SCO.\nSun's hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive.

Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Malcolm believes\nthat \"criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary to\npreserve the viability of America's content industries.\" Malcolm also\nbelieves that people who trade copyrighted material think they are\nparticipating in a legal activity. I certainly think people who download\ncopyrighted works understand that such distribution--barring provisions\nsuch as fair use--is not authorized, and it is not surprising to see\nbusinesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution of\ncopyrighted works.\n\"Some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpful...I think\nthey would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminal\nprosecution,\" said [RIAA President Cary] Sherman, who was on the same\nconference panel.\nI'm not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect Sherman is\nhoping for. Although infrequent, there have already been civil suits or\nwarnings issued to private individuals, and they have served as minor\ndeterrents to the file-sharing community at large. Criminal lawsuits\ncarrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generate\nfurther animosity against groups such as the RIAA and may be difficult to\ninitiate because of the \"schooling\" effect of millions of systems\nparticipating in file sharing. Only servers would seem to stand out from\nthe crowd.\nThe article cites the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act [2], which defines\nillegal  activity and maximum penalties for copyright infringement:\nCriminal infringement: Any person who infringes a copyright willfully for\npurposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, or by the\nreproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any\n180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more\ncopyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000....\nFor purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction or distribution\nof a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be sufficient to establish\nwillful infringement.\n...\nThe term \"financial gain\" includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, of\nanything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.\nTherefore, receipt of a work of value would be defined as \"financial gain\"\neven if no money is involved. The NET Act excerpt does not clarify how the\nvalue of a work is determined; an album or movie could be worth only $15\nto millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from the\nperspective of the consumer or copyright holder.\nThe statute of limitations:\n507. Limitations on actions\n(a) Criminal Proceedings.--No criminal proceeding shall be maintained\nunder the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within five\nyears after the cause of action arose.\n(b) Civil Actions.--No civil action shall be maintained under the\nprovisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after\nthe claim accrued.\nThe penalties are too extensive to list here, but they can be found in\nSection 2319: Criminal infringement of a copyright. In general, first-time\ncriminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of 1 year.\nI'm still not sure where the DOJ would start in choosing people to\nprosecute because of the aforementioned \"schooling\" effect, but my guess\nwould be that, just like speeding, primarily the most prominent\nindividuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will be\ntargeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers.

Sigma Designs [1] is a\ncompany  looking to put out hardware to playback, amongst other things,\ndivx files. Problem is Sigma is using XviDs gpled code in ways not very\ngpl. The  results....XviD stops work on thier code and ask the users to\nput preasure  on Sigma to honor the GPL.\nSome notes from other places....\n>>From Doom9 [3]\n\"XviD development has been stopped! The Sigma Designs REALMagic MPEG-4\nVideo Codec contains wide portions of code taken from the XviD project.\nSoon after the initial release of the REALMagic codec the XviD developers\nhave contacted Sigma and informed them about the GPL violation (for those\nwho don't know, XviD is distributed under the GNU Public License - GPL -\nwhich demands that if you modify a GPL program you have to release it\nunder the GPL, which in this case means that the source code of the Sigma\ncodec must be freely available). Sigma promised to replace the stolen\ncode, but the new version of the codec which was released this month only\ndisguises the stolen code, it was not actually removed. Sigma was once\nagain contacted and asked to remove the offending code but until today\nnothing has happened. Therefore the XviD team is now turning to the public\nin the hope to receive wide public support in their efforts to convince\nSigma Designs to respect the terms of the GPL. And until the matter has\nbeen resolved XviD development will not continue.\nThat being said I hope all the forum members who saw their threads about\nthe Sigma Codecs being closed will understand our motivation now.\nInternally we already knew what was going on but since the XviD authors\nfirst wanted to try and resolve this internally we respected their wishes\nand kept quiet about the matter at hand.\n[Update] Sigma has issued a press release announcing the availability of\nthe source code of their MPEG-4 codec and it's already up for download.\nHowever, not a word was lost about the XviD issue and the press release\nmakes one think that the Sigma codec was entirely developed by Sigma so we\nmight be hearing more about this.\n[Update] I found a GPL notice in some of the source code files, but it\nalso looks like Sigma placed their own copyright lines there and XviD\ndoesn't get any credit in the source either. The GPL notice also collides\nwith Sigma's Software Licensing Agreement that you have to sign before\ndownloading codec or source. On on the same issue DivXNetworks said they'd\nfully support XviD in this issue and apparently DXn's relationship with\nSigma didn't really work out either, as Sigma's Xcard is not as DivX\ncompatible as it was advertised.\n[Update]First an update on the XviD situation. The release of the Sigma\nsource code does not mean it's all over, it's far from being over. The\nlicense agreement which you have to agree to before you can download, and\ninstall the codec is not compatible with the GPL. Furthermore, it can now\nclearly be seen (download the source code and have a look for yourself)\nthat the Sigma codec is pretty much a copy of the XviD codec, but all the\ncopyright notices of the original developers have been removed and\nreplaced. This does not only violate the GPL but copyright laws - you\ncan't just take a program, change a few lines and change the copyright\nstatements, you only have copyright protection for the parts you wrote on\nyour own. And related to this the Sigma codec also contains code taken\nfrom the OpenDivX project, the files were outfitted with 2 different\ncopyright notices which is quite funny.\"\n[1] http:\/\/www.xvid.org\/\n[2] http:\/\/www.sigmadesigns.com\n[3] http:\/\/www.doom9.org\/\nhttp:\/\/xent.com\/mailman\/listinfo\/fork","152":"SpamAssassin is hurting democracy!\nOwen\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nhttp:\/\/www.bayarea.com\/mld\/mercurynews\/news\/opinion\/3900215.htm\nInternet can level the political playing field\nBy Mike McCurry and Larry Purpuro\nNOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one\nof the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping\nmalls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front\nstoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in\npublic office. While chances are high that we won't know them\npersonally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and\nask for our votes.\nJust as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it\nhas begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.\nIn this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State\nBill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail\naddresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent\neach an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.\nThat day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more\nexpensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio\nspots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of\n35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.\nHad Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have\nbeen equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters\nwould have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones\nthrough any of those channels.\nThe response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He\nwas lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost\nentirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been\nrefined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice\n``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.\nHis detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but\nbecause the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign\nmay have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money\nin politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication\nmediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.\nNo one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be\nhighly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society,\nit's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different\nunsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.\nThe debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress\nthat would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We\nbelieve e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or\nTV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A\nsimple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of\nfuture mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be\ntaken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.\nWhen a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the\nInternet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them\nto perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60\npercent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail\naccounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.\nCandidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the\nJones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better\nensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient\ngroups.\nBut the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter\nan e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without\nopening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage\nthe sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam\nadvocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail.\nPolitical candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best\nthey can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMike McCurry, former press secretary for President Clinton, is CEO of an\nadvocacy management and communications software company. Larry Purpuro,\nthe former Republican National Committee deputy chief of staff, is\nfounder and president of a political e-marketing firm.

Most\nmailers will work around this and display the mail 'correctly', some\nmight not though. Eg the message might not be displayed, or the\ndisclaimer might not be displayed.\n1c. the correct place for disclaimers is on the client side. this\nalso allows the user to select appropriate disclaimer for appropriate\ncontext (or no disclaimer at all).\n2. blanket appended disclaimers are of dubious legal effectiveness.\n(dilution, NU case in UK)\n3. generic disclaimer text is of dubious legal effectiveness. indeed\nit will often be completely inappropriate ('this message is\nconfidential' on list mail). see 1c.

I like all my exmh stuff\nin nice columns (fits the display better).   That is, I use the detached\nfolder list, one column.
